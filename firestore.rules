/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a public-read, restricted-write model for awareness campaigns and a create-only model for anonymous reports.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /campaigns/{campaignId}: Publicly readable collection of awareness campaigns. Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete campaigns.
 * - /anonymous_reports/{reportId}: Collection of anonymous reports. Any user can create a report, but listing, getting, updating, or deleting reports is disallowed.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Campaigns are publicly readable to maximize awareness.
 * - Anonymous reports are create-only to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
 * - Data validation is minimal during this prototyping phase, focusing on authorization and relational integrity rather than complete schema enforcement.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: N/A
 * Structural Segregation: Separate collections for campaigns and anonymous reports to allow different access control policies.
